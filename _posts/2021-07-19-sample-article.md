excerpt: "For over a century, Texas was a solidly Democratic state. But because of the party switch and conservative fearmongering, it is now a bastion of the GOP. It is also because of these same forces that a progressive, rejuvinated Democratic party could soon return to power in the Lone Star State."

In the beginning of the 20th century, [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) was a reliably Democratic state. The reason? Republicans were vilified throughout the south for being the "party that did the civil war" so even progressives aligned with the Democrats instead of the Republicans back then. This was the result of many things.

I'm saying even progressives aligned with the Democrats because by and large, the Democrats were the right wing party back then and the Republicans were the left wing party. Due to a very long process that by some accounts started in the 1870s and never quite ended, called the Party Switch, the Democrats became the left wing party and the Republicans became the right wing party.

Still, in the early 20th century, neither party was ideologically homogeneous. There were conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats. In general, conservative democrats dominated Texan politics but progressives had some successes. The Texan public was mostly conservative during that time period but not by a very big margin. In fact, before the 1950s Houston was the hub of civil rights activism in the country. And when those progressives engaged in party politics, they got involved in the Democratic party (including founding what is now Houston's official branch of the Democratic party).

Because of all of those things, Texas liked conservative Democrats on the federal level. But that begun to change. In the 1920s, Liberal Democrats begun to gain power in the national democratic party, and they eventually nominated a progressive candidate in 1928 - Al Smith (his running mate? Franklin Delano Roosevelt). The people in charge of the Texas Democrats did not like Smith and started aggressively promoting the Republican candidate for president. In 1928, Texas voted for a Republican for the first time - Herbert Hoover. This would prove to be the biggest mistake conservatives ever made in Texas.

# Enter The GOP

In 1932 the Progressive Democrat candidate, FDR, won Texas by the largest margin of any candidate who ever ran in the state. iirc 93% of Texans voted for FDR. For reference, Trump won Texas with 52% of the vote. As it turned out, Texas voters had an affinity for socially conservative but economically progressive candidates. FDR would win Texas all 4 times he ran, and Truman won the state too.

Conservative democrats, entering panic mode, started engaging in very explicit scare campaign against civil rights and labor activists. For instance conservative democrat governor Allen Shivers effectively kicked the NAACP out of Texas in 1952. This strategy worked very well for conservatives and has practically been their strategy ever since. Meanwhile, those conservative politicians gradually moved to the Republican party, which has never had a progressive branch in Texas (remember the party switch?). They also took their organizing infrastructure and voters with them. Texas ended up being a swing state for most of the 20th century but last voted for a Democrat in 1976 with Jimmy Carter - himself a relatively conservative Democrat.

By 2003, the remaining Texas democrats were the weakened vestiges of what was left from the NAACP, Texas labor orgs, and 1960s orgs like the SCLC. As a result, they were very progressive (even for Democrats), but effectively paralyzed from winning elections in any district but those explicitly gerrymandered to favor them

This is why the last few elections have been so significant for Texas. Sure, Hillary, Biden and Beto didn't win in Texas, but they got incredibly close. And there does seem to be a general trend in Texas moving to the left. Bernie did very well here in the 2020 primaries as well, suggesting that this isn't just all democrats gaining strength but the start of a new generation of explicitly progressive Democrats reviving the party here.
